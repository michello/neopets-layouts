<h1 id="welcome">welcome to the crazy</h1>
<p>Hi there! If you're reading this, you're either new, reacquainting with our policies, or stalking us (and if you're the latter, that's cool. We dig every type of deres, including the yanderes. *wink*). Anyways, <i>welcome to MuxHo!</i></p>
<p>We're a chill, chat based guild with <b>a pretense of being anime/manga themed</b> for the sake of seeming like a legitimate guild. 
</p>


<h1 id="messages">messages</h1>
<p>You may have read the rules on our webbie but we can't help but stress our policies with posting on the message board enough: 
</p>
<ol><li>Please don't post more than three times in a row!</li>
<li>
Use a legible font. Please make sure your text font, or neoHTML, is colored black or another dark shade so it's legible!</li>
<li>
Add your name to your signature or userlookup! We prefer to <i>have your name in your signature</i> since it's a hassle having to go through the pesky captchas to view your lookup.</li>
<li>
If there's an existing conversation, <b>DON'T be afraid</b> to jump right into it. :* Or you can also start your own conversation. We're chatterboxes. We don't mind!</li>
</ol><h1 id="participation">participation policy</h1>
<p>We understand if real life gets in the way but MuxHo is also not a place to let your accounts clutter. This may be new to older members but PLEASE make an effort to post at least <i>once a week</i> and <b>ten times in a month</b>. Otherwise you may be in jeopardy of getting swept from the guild.</p>
<p>
If you do have any emergency that prevents you from making the required amount, do neomail one of the council members ahead of time!</p>

<h1 id="lyfe">muxho life & culture</h1>
<p>We're a pretty chill crowd so don't worry about having to think of every weeb content you can include in a comment! More often than not, our conversations circles around our everyday life so don't be afraid to be yourself. If you're comfortable, be sure to join our <i>FB group</i>, which is of the same name as our guild (Mugen no Hoshi), to be updated on when AMW is.</p>
<p>
That said, we do highly recommend participating in <b>AMW, or anime movie weekends</b>. It's a one day event that is usually held on Saturdays, or whenever the council members decides to have it. It's a great way to bond with other members in an unconstrained environment. For more information of the event, <a href="/~muxhoshumi">click here</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also have activities occasionally to celebrate the season, holiday, etc. Feel free to glance at <a href="/~catalinaflo">our activities page</a> to see what they're like.
</p>

<h1 id="tech">the tech</h1>
<p>
And where would we be in life without technology? As you know, Neopets has a really terrible user experience, with many problems unaddressed. To combat and make the user experience better, we've come up with technological solutions!</p>
<p>Feel free to neomail <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=mochadroppe">michelle</a> if you have a software idea for the guild that you want to be made!</p>
<h2>neoify || github @ ml4963/neoify</h2>
<p>We all know it can be a pain to wait for someone to post on the message board. Fear not! If you use google chrome, you can get our chrome extension that both <i>alerts you when someone makes a post</i> and <b>tells you whether your typed out message will bypass filters or not</b>.</p>
<p>
If you are also interested in helping out with bumping the guild ad board, this extension will also alert you when the ad board <i>falls below too low</i> in the GC.
</p>
<h2>neotracker || github @ ml4963/neotracker</h2>
<p>This app is more for council members but as a member,
 it can be confusing to keep track the number of posts you've made over the couple weeks and make sure you're not in danger of getting swept.</p>
<p>NeoTracker <b>not only keeps track of how many posts you've made</b> on a daily basis, it also <i>shows how many posts the guild has made</i>!</p>
<p>Check when guild is most busy to get in on the fun or when it's least, to help stir up conversations.</p>
