<h1>about me</h1>
<p>Hi there! Welcome to my pseudo portfolio slash get to know me page! My name is Michelle and I previously went by <b>mochadroppe</b> before I got sadly iced. Long story short about why I got iced: I had a script running to help me <a href="#kad">kad</a>, which is of course against the rules but the programmer side of me couldn't help it.
</p>
<p>Speaking of programmer, when it comes to offsite, I'm <i>studying computer science</i> in my last year of college! I love being able to create scripts and programs that help aid me in whatever issues I come across, which results in me creating scripts that help me manage what I really enjoy about this site, <a href="#guild">my guild</a>.</p>
<p>
Aside from that, I love watching korean drama and binging Netflix shows in my spare time. A more recent show I've been watching is a delightful show called <b>Sense8</b>, which is about human connection and what's it like to be an individual. 
</p>

<div id="neogoals">
<h1 style="text-align: left;">neogoals</h1>
<p>Despite the fact that I didn't really accomplish much NR on my original main (lulz), I still would like to restore the accomplishments I've made previously: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li><b style="letter-spacing: 5px;">[ ]</b> Earn at least 10 million NP</li>
<li><b style="letter-spacing: 5px;">[ ]</b> Feed 75 kadoaties</li>
<li><b style="letter-spacing: 5px;">[ ]</b> Max pets' intelligence</li>
<li><b style="letter-spacing: 5px;">[ ]</b> Complete a <a href="#custom">customization</a></li>
</ul></div>

<div id="kad">
<h1>kad</h1>
<p>I never really did anything NR here in the site besides working on <a href="#guild">my guild</a> but I guess the lure of getting that spiffy cute pink kadoatie avatar has gotten me.</p>
<p>
Below are the screenshots of the kadoaties I have fed through this account! (Hover over image to see when I fed the kad.)

<a href="/~muhowebbie"><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/28b7in4.png"></a><a href="/~muhowebbie"><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/6s9rb7.gif"></a>
<a href="/~muhowebbie"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a1SSXmt.gif"></a>


<p>Honestly, where would I be without <a href="/~muhowebbie">muxho</a>? <b>MuxHo</b> was a guild started in August 2014, by me and my friend, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=tsubasakuraika"> Jane</a>. We had a simple idea: we wanted to create a community that invites anime and manga fans and allows them to talk and form long lasting relationships. </p>

<p>
Admittedly, we had our bumps. Our guild was deleted after I got my first account silenced/warned because of our Zankyou no Terror themed layout (in other words, I'm dumb). More dumb mistakes were made with us making messages that included offsite links and I guess it's sad to say, but the whole experience has pretty much desensitized me to getting iced (probably why although I was upset over )
</p>
<p>
Anywho, aside from the consistent rule breaking over the years, I've also made amazing friends in the guild. While many come and go, I still manage to talk with them once in awhile offsite and recall fond memories I've had with them. 
</p>
<p>
And it's probably for this reason even though <b>MuxHo</b> has seen around six resignations, I've still remained in this little community, unable to let it go. Because as cheesy as this may sound, MuxHo is pretty much embedded in my life and the people in the community have been a great support circle and family over the years I've known them.

<div id="tech">
<h1>my tech</h1>
<p>
As mentioned and hinted in my <a href="#me">intro</a>, I love creating technologies that better aid my experiences around the web. And because going on Neopets and visiting my guild is such an integral part of my life, I love creating applications that help me and my guild mates with their web experiences.
</p>
<p>
Without further ado, here they are:
</p>
<h2>neoify • github/neoify @ ml4963</h2>
<p>Alerts members in guild when a person or new message has been posted in the guild board & checks the message a user is typing for words that are censored by the site.</p>
<h2>neotracker • github/neotracker @ ml4963</h2>
<p>Tracks member post count activity and stores it to later make graphs that displays guild activeness.</p>
</div>

<div id="credit">
<h1>credit</h1>
<p>guild buttons used are credited to their respective creators: ___</p>
<p>neopets background of the layouts is also credited to its respective creator (will specify when i figure out who it is).</p>
<p>photoshop work and code is done entirely by <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=myonigiri">moi</a></p>
